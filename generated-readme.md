## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions &mdash; this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

To strengthen my skills in Node.JS, I was tasked with creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). This allows any project creator to devote more time to working on their project, and ensures that they haven't missed any important information when working on a readme file to add to their repository.
